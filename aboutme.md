title: About me
---

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at University of North Carolina, Charlotte.  I obtained my bachelors degree in Information Technology from R.M.K. Engineering College, Anna University.  I have attained certificates in IBM RAD, IBM DB2 and IBM Blue scholar distinction.  

I have 2 years of work experience in TATA Consultancy Services where I have worked in a project to create and support a Pricing Tool for Marriott which gives the optimized pricing point for a particular company based on the historical data like the hotel room availability, travel history and the demand. My work was greatly appreciated by my managers and clients.  

In my graduate studies, I have developed mobile and web applications.  Recently I have won the IBM category award “Best use of Bluemix” in a hackathon conducted by University of North Carolina, Chappell Hill.  I am enthusiastic and excited to explore new opportunities.
