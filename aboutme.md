title: About me
---

My dream for long has been to gain in depth knowledge and to contribute meaningfully to the field Computer Science, which I am very much passionate about.  I found it intellectually stimulating and hence resolved to pursue a career in Computer Science.  This ambition had led me to complete my bachelor's in Information Technology from Anna University.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I have worked in TATA Consultancy Services for 2 years where I have developed a Pricing Tool for Marriott which gives the optimized pricing point for a particular company based on the historical data like the hotel room availability, travel history and the demand. I have been recognized as a Star performer for getting highest band in the performance appraisal process and awarded with “Asset to the Team Award”. I left TCS to complete my master's degree.

I am graduated with Masters in Computer Science from University of North Carolina, Charlotte.  In my graduate studies, I have developed mobile and web applications.  Recently I have won the IBM category award “Best use of Bluemix” in a hackathon conducted by University of North Carolina, Chappell Hill.  I am enthusiastic and excited to explore new opportunities.
